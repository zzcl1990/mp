The information revolution is bringing changes that are not always seen as positive to the people they affect. Nevertheless there is a strong feeling that the changes it brings are inevitable and that our efforts should be devoted to advancing, enjoying, and profiting from cyber technologies rather than restraining them. But do our efforts in this direction risk the emergence of a cyber dystopia in which many, perhaps most, people are significantly harmed by technology advances? This course focuses on insights into the downsides of this technological progress. We will characterize key aspects of the problem, assess their severity, predict their future, speculate on how much of what we are facing is inevitable, and think about what steps might avoid the most undesirable outcomes. This will be guided by reading and class discussion of recent works on the topic and a project. Learn more from the course web site https://tinyurl.com/cyberdystopia.

Course description: Computer communication networks are among the most important and influential global infrastructures that humanity has created. The goal of this course is to provide a foundational view of communication networks, with a focus on networks enabling modern hyperscale cloud computing. In the first part of this course, we’ll study the principles upon which the Internet and other computer networks are built, and how those principles translate into deployed protocols. (The material in this first part overlaps with CS 438.) In the second part of this course, we build on those principles to learn how to build a network infrastructure that provides the agility to deploy virtual networks on a shared infrastructure, that enables both efficient transfer of big data and low latency communication, and that enables applications to be federated across countries and continents. Topics will include: switching; intradomain routing; the Internet Protocol and interdomain networking; reliability, flow control, congestion control, and their embodiment in TCP; quality of service; network applications; cloud network requirements and traffic patterns; data center network architecture; virtualized and software-defined networks; and wide-area connectivity. The course will involve a significant amount of Unix-based network programming and assumes some familiarity with C or C++. One shorter programming project employs Python. Students will implement realistic network protocols, and gain the perspective of real-world networking challenges through interviews with industry professionals and academic researchers. Credit will not be given for both CS 438 and CS 498 CN1.

In the first part of this course, we’ll study the principles upon which the Internet and other computer networks are built, and how those principles translate into deployed protocols. In the second part of this course, we build on those principles to learn how to build a network infrastructure that provides the agility to deploy virtual networks on a shared infrastructure, that enables both efficient transfer of big data and low latency communication, and that enables applications to be federated across countries and continents.  Topics will include: switching; intradomain routing; the Internet Protocol and interdomain networking; reliability, flow control, congestion control, and their embodiment in TCP; quality of service; network applications; cloud network requirements and traffic patterns; data center network architecture; virtualized and software-defined networks; and wide-area connectivity. The course will involve a significant amount of Unix-based network programming and assumes some familiarity with C or C++. One shorter programming project employs Python. Students will implement realistic network protocols, and gain the perspective of real-world networking challenges through interviews with industry professionals and academic researchers.  This course is only for students that are in the online Computer Science MCS/MCS-DS Program. Additional ProctorU fees may apply.  Credit will not be given for both CS 438 and CS 498 CNO.",

This course teaches a deep understanding of IoT technologies from the ground up. Students will learn IoT device programming (Arduino and Raspberry Pi), sensing and actuating technologies, IoT protocol stacks (Zigbee, 5G, NFC, MQTT, etc), networking backhaul design and security enforcement, data science for IoT, and cloud-based IoT platforms such as AWS IoT. Students will be guided through laboratory assignments designed to give them practical real-world experience, where they will deploy a distributed wifi monitoring service, a cloud-based IoT service platform serving tens of thousands of heartbeat sensors, and more. Students will emerge from the class with a cutting-edge education on this rapidly emerging technology segment, and with the confidence to carry out tasks they will commonly encounter in industrial settings.",

What will come to replace it?  A strong competitor is the clean-slate “operating function” approach of Urbit.  Jocosely branded as “computing for Martians,” Urbit provides a fresh and updated vision of what Internet computing could come to look like in future years.  Featuring end-to-end encryption and true peer-to-peer routing built on a network-first operating system, Urbit fosters decentralized digital societies and stable user identities. Our primary objectives in this course are for you to be able to explain and navigate the technical layout of Urbit, as well as construct novel applications for Arvo, the Urbit operating function, using the Hoon programming language. Lessons focus on conceptual or architectural aspects of Urbit, including technical discussions of Urbit’s behavior and internals. Labs are hands-on tutorials to familiarize students with operations and language features.

We will select ten trending topics such as deep neural networks for Information Extraction, never-ending knowledge acquisition, zero-shot learning for cross-domain transfer. and give a comprehensive overview for each topic. We will review where we have been (the most successful methods in literature),   and where we are going (the remaining challenges, and novel methods to tackle these challenges). The target audience of this course is PhD students who do thesis research related to these topics. We also expect to invite several top researchers in this field to give guest lectures. The goal is for each student to have at least one solid paper submission ready at the end of this course. We will select classic papers about each topic and ask students to duplicate the core algorithms and even advance state-of-the-art with new ideas. We also aim to strengthen everyone’s presentation and writing skills, so we will do peer review on the presentations and paper submissions.

Entirely online with some mix of asynchronous and synchronous components that may vary over the semester and based on needs of students and instructor.   This course will be a broad introduction to algorithms for curves and graphs embedded in the plane or other surfaces.  Algorithmic questions about curves have been a driving force in topology since its inception more than a century ago.  Planar and near-planar graphs have long been fertile ground for algorithms research, both because they naturally model many classes of networks that arise in practice, and because they admit simpler and faster algorithms than more general graphs.  There is a rich interplay between these two domains, drawing on a common pool of techniques from geometry, topology, and combinatorics.  Potential topics include topological graph theory; homotopy, homology, and other topological invariants; specialized algorithms for shortest paths, maximum flows, and minimum cuts; efficient approximation schemes for NP-hard problems; and applications in VLSI design, computer graphics, computer vision, motion planning, geographic information systems, and other areas of computing.  Specific topics will depend on the interest and expertise of the students. Students in all areas of computer science, mathematics, and related disciplines are welcome.   CS 473 and/or Math 525 are recommended as prerequisites, but not required; necessary background material will be introduced as needed.

Topic:  Energy-Efficient Computer Architecture This course will discuss recent issues and research trends in designing computer architectures for energy efficiency. The course will start with an analysis of process variation and wear-out, which constrains and affects energy efficiency. We will examine models and techniques for variation tolerance at different levels. They include body biasing, processors with timing speculation, and variation-aware application scheduling. We will then focus on low-voltage computer architecture, which is our best hope for energy efficiency. We will examine how to reduce voltage guard-bands and manage voltage droops. Higher-level techniques include pipeline design for low voltage, efficient eDRAM refresh, extensive power gating, and effective on-chip controllers. Next, we will consider 3D architectures and how they can improve energy efficiency. Finally, we will focus on extreme-scale computer architectures, which are designed from the ground up for energy efficiency.

The course will start with an analysis of process variation and wear-out, which constrains and affects energy efficiency. We will examine models and techniques for variation tolerance at different levels. They include body biasing, processors with timing speculation, and variation-aware application scheduling. We will then focus on low-voltage computer architecture, which is our best hope for energy efficiency. We will examine how to reduce voltage guard-bands and manage voltage droops. Higher-level techniques include pipeline design for low voltage, efficient eDRAM refresh, extensive power gating, and effective on-chip controllers. Next, we will consider 3D architectures and how they can improve energy efficiency. Finally, we will focus on extreme-scale computer architectures, which are designed from the ground up for energy efficiency. They will bring together all of the concepts discussed in the course into a single platform.

The Internet is home to a panoply of varieties of human interaction. Social media, interactive games, telepresence, online environments, and simple text e-mails now mediate our normal experiences of education, medicine, politics, business, sociality, collective action, and more. Unbeknownst to many users, these systems incorporate algorithmic interventions that alter prior expectations.  As the Internet has become an infrastructure for social life and society itself, our ability to measure and represent that society is transforming.  This class explores the presentation of self, the presentation of collectives, the presentation of news, and social dynamics in these online spaces — and how algorithmic intervention shapes them from the perspective of social signalling theory.   Topics covered include: resumes of the 22nd century, why people share “fake” news, the mitigation of trolling, ethics, and bias in social media systems. Upon completion of this course, students will have an up-to-date understanding of the design of social media interfaces with incentive structures from social signaling theory.

In the standard machine learning paradigm, a model is trained on a set of examples and is specialized for the single task it is trained for. By contrast, meta-learning is performed on a set of tasks and leverages prior experiences when tackling a new task. This course will cover foundation principles, historical perspective, and recent progress of meta-learning. We will position meta-learning with respect to related areas, such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning. The course will also discuss various applications of meta-learning in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and robotics. Students will be required to present and critique research papers and perform a related research project. By the end of the course, students will be able to understand and implement the state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms and be ready to conduct research in this direction.   Prerequisites: CS 446 or an equivalent machine learning course or permission of the instructor is required. CS 543 or an equivalent computer vision course is recommended but not required.",

Description: The field of game theory analyses organizations/settings where rational selfish agents interact, like voting, (spectrum) auctions, social networks, mediations, and bargaining. For such organizations, it aims to study their stable outcomes, designing rules to achieve good stable outcomes, welfare loss, dynamics, etc.. Algorithmic game theory studies computational aspects of each of these aspects, e.g., how fast we can compute the solutions.  The goal of this course is to expose students to three main objectives of algorithmic game theory: (i) analysis and algorithms for stable outcomes (games, equilibria, and computation), (ii) efficient rule design to achieve good stable outcomes (mechanism design and fair-division), and (iii) analysis of welfare loss and dynamics (selfish routing and price-of-anarchy). A research/survey project will be a major part of this course. Being a theory course, CS 473 or equivalent is recommended as a pre-requisite.

Course Name:  Approximate and Probabilistic Computing Across the Stack  Course Abstract: The current drive for energy-efficiency has made approximation a key concept in designing and implementing software in various areas, such as data analytics, mobile computing, multimedia processing, and engineering simulations. This course will focus on foundations and system-level techniques for representing uncertainty in program's data and reasoning about profitable tradeoffs between accuracy, reliability, and energy consumption. In addition to selected algorithmic-level approximations, we will study (i) programming languages that natively operate on probabilistic and/or uncertain data, (ii) compilers that automatically approximate programs while verifying or testing the accuracy of optimized programs, and (iii) hardware devices that expose approximate components. The course will include lectures, reading research papers, in-class discussions, and a final research project.

Who this is for: The course will help graduate students aspiring to become bioinformatics researchers as well as students who are interested in data sciences in general and are looking for interesting applications. The course is less ideal for students interested in a casual exposure to the buzz surrounding bioinformatics. A research project (conceptualization and implementation) is a major component of the course grade, making the course unsuitable for students with little or no programming experience.  Syllabus will tentatively include: Basic Molecular Biology, Probability/Statistics (probabilistic modeling, hypothesis testing, sampling), Introduction to Selected Bioinformatics topics (such as sequence alignment, enhancer prediction, epigenomics, modeling of gene expression, modeling of population evolution), and research paper reading on the selected topics.

In undergraduate algorithms classes, you have studied classical problems such as all-pairs shortest paths, longest common subsequence, edit distance, 3SUM, subset sum, triangles in graphs, etc.  Have you ever wondered whether the textbook algorithms you have learned could be improved, or whether they are in fact the best possible?  Here, we are interested not just in determining whether the problems are polynomial-time solvable, but in their \"\"fine-grained\"\" complexity (quadratic time? cubic time? etc.).  We will describe the latest theoretical techniques for obtaining (slightly) improved algorithms for these classical problems and their variants (in general as well as important special cases).  We will also prove conditional lower bounds via reductions that relate the fine-grained complexity of one problem to another.

  "description" : "The purpose of the course is to give each student enough background and training in the area of algorithmic genomic biology so that each will be able to do research in this area, and publish papers. The main focus of the course is phylogeny (evolutionary tree) estimation, multiple sequence alignment, and genome-scale phylogenetics, which are problems that present very interesting challenges from a computational and statistical standpoint. Time permitting, we will also discuss computational problems in microbiome analysis, protein function and structure prediction, genome assembly, and even historical linguistics. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology. The technical material will depend on discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: CS 374 and CS 361/STAT 361, or consent of instructor.",

Each semester, CS 225 offers a one credit hour honors section that covers an advanced topic in CS related to data structures (offered as CS 296, Section 25). This is the honors component to receive James Scholar or HCLA credit for CS 225. As an honors course, CS 296 will be much less structured than CS 225 and requires significant independent work and learning.  This semester, CS 296 will focus on algorithms and data structures used to process sequences of characters (string data) and their use in large-scale data collections. Topics will include string search, string data structures, inexact matching, and sketching data structures. While heavily motivated by Big Data problems in genomics, no knowledge of biology is assumed. Assignments and projects will be done primarily in C++.",
